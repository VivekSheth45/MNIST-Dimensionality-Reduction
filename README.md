# MNIST Dimensionality Reduction

This project applies PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP to the MNIST dataset for dimensionality reduction and visualization. It compares execution time and clustering quality (Silhouette Score) to evaluate each methodâ€™s effectiveness.

## Features
- Implements PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP for 2D visualization
- Compares models based on execution time and Silhouette Score
- Uses Git LFS for handling large datasets

## Installation

git clone git@github.com:Viveksheth45/MNIST-Dimensionality-Reduction.git
cd MNIST-Dimensionality-Reduction
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook MNIST-Dimensionality-Reduction.ipynb
